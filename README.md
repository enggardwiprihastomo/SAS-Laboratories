# SAS Laboratories
Here are the collection of SAS codes with 4GL, SQL, Macro, and Functions that I made. These codes are part of the SAS subject at Politechnika Warszawska.
During the studies we were given tasks for every week/laboratory. I managed to complete all the tasks with 100/100 points for the labs and 26/30 points for the exam.
